# Preface

## Prerequisites
> *I recommend having taken an introductory course in computer science (particularly using C++) and/or having experience programming before reading our C++ articles.* <br>
> My go-to for getting into C++ is https://learncpp.com.

## Abstract
This catalogue is focused towards college students currently learning computer science, engineering students that learn programming as part of their career, and hobbyist programmers that wish to explore the subject in their free time.

The purpose of these articles is to present intermediate and advanced concepts and information from https://cppreference.com and https://wikipedia.org in a manner more digestible for inexperienced users, allowing readers to develop greater understandings of advanced subjects without having to read overwhelming information. Of course, citations and references to the aforementioned sites will be made, as they are much greater sources of information than Gnegd.

## Introduction - For Computer Science Students
So, you just finished your first course or two in computer science. Maybe you finally finished that one project using circular doubly linked-lists, or hash trees, or whatever else. Or maybe you're still in the middle of the semester, or the middle of that one project, and want to expand your current knowledge. Perhaps you're totally lost on that one assignment and have been scouring through the internet for answers -- if this last one applies to you, *good on you* for Googling, it is your most powerful tool as a developer.

If any of these sound like your situation, or if you're simply a student studying computer science, these articles were tailored with you in mind. As you explore these articles, the hope is that your knowledge on both computer science and C++ broadens more than what your courses teach.

Of course, this takes no credence from the courses themselves. Computer science courses are not designed to be software development courses. Rather, they are tailored towards teaching computer science as a *science*, teaching you the fundamentals of computer science, as well as the various subjects that are derived from it.

## Introduction - For Engineers/Engineering Students
There is little doubt that engineers and engineering students alike are not known for clean code. After all, programming is not on their payroll, though programming often becomes a consequential part of the job. Indeed, engineers that have to write code are only doing so to get that *one thing* working, and pay no mind to the scalability nor the readability of production code.

If this applies to you, or if you're hoping to avoid meeting this fate, then these articles are for you! The hope is that engineers can learn as much as possible about applied computer science and programming with the goal of writing clean -- and correct -- code.

*Note: At some point or another, we may cover topics on embedded systems programming, but this is TBD.*

## Introduction - For Hobbyists
Welcome! These articles have been written with students in mind, however they are meant no less for people that are either self-taught, or simply like to broaden their horizons on their own time. Having come this far on your own, I suspect you to be the harshest critic of these articles. Edits, corrections, and suggestions, of course, are welcome.

*Note: Comment section functionality TBD.*
